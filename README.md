# Crime Canary

What is Crime Canary?
---------------------

Crime Canary is a framework that involves the Algorand block chain technology for the **incentivization** and **automation** of law enforcement reporting. Specifically, a user (civilian) can utilize the framework to report an incident, a crime, etc. to a local law enforcement via their submission of an image. Additionally, if the submission is proven to be valid, the user is then rewarded with governmental crypto-coins, which can be traded for approved services. 

This is a research project and not an official product of any governmental entities. Expect bugs and sharp edges.
